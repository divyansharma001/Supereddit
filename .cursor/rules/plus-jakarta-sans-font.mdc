# Font Usage Rule

Always use 'Plus Jakarta Sans' as the primary font for all UI components and pages. The font is imported in [globals.css](mdc:client/src/app/globals.css) and should be referenced in all custom styles and inline style overrides as needed.

Example usage:
```css
font-family: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', ui-sans-serif, system-ui, ...;
```

If you need to add or override font styles in components, ensure 'Plus Jakarta Sans' is used for consistency and a modern look.
