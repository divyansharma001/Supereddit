# Bento Grid UI & Animation Guidelines

- The bento grid section is implemented in [page.tsx](mdc:client/src/app/page.tsx) and styled in [globals.css](mdc:client/src/app/globals.css).
- Use a clean, professional layout with ample white space and subtle slate backgrounds.
- Minimize the use of orange; use it only for accents or highlights, not as a dominant background.
- Ensure the grid is fully responsive: use `sm`, `md`, and `col-span` classes to adapt to all screen sizes.
- Card backgrounds should be white or light slate, with soft borders and shadows for separation.
- Animations should be subtle: use gentle fade/slide-in for entrance and light hover elevation.
- Typography and spacing should match the hero section for a cohesive look.
- Avoid visual clutter and keep the interface modern and easy to scan.
