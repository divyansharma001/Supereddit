# Bento Grid UI Rule

- Implement a beautiful, modern bento grid section below the hero and video sections on the homepage.
- Use 'Plus Jakarta Sans' as the primary font for all grid content (see [plus-jakarta-sans-font.mdc](mdc:plus-jakarta-sans-font.mdc)).
- The grid should feature visually distinct cards/tiles with varying sizes (e.g., 2x2, 1x2, 2x1) for a dynamic layout.
- Use soft gradients, subtle shadows, and rounded corners for a sleek, professional look.
- Each bento card should have a clear purpose (feature, benefit, testimonial, etc.), with bold headings, supporting text, and optional icons or images.
- Ensure the grid is fully responsive and looks great on all screen sizes.
- Maintain generous whitespace and consistent spacing between cards.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for layout and styling.
- Example grid structure:

```jsx
<section className="bento-grid ...">
  <div className="bento-card ...">...</div>
  <div className="bento-card ...">...</div>
  ...
</section>
```

- Reference this rule when creating or updating the bento grid section.
